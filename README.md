To present a Harvard architecture processor diagram. The processor must contain at least 3 registers: 2 for data and one for the instruction counter.

The processor must perform operations of copying data from memory to registers and from registers to memory, addition, shift left and right, logical operations "and" and "or", comparison, conditional transition operations (if there is a certain value in one of the registers, change the address of the next instruction, otherwise we move on sequentially). ALU works only with registers and puts the result in one of the registers.

To test the processor's performance, it will need to demonstrate the multiplication of two unsigned numbers. At the beginning of the work, the numbers are stored in memory, after the calculations are completed, the result is placed in memory.
